# How to learn
## My name is Victoria Matynyan. This is my first project at [Yandex Praktikum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/).
**_How to learn_** is a landing page presenting various ideas and techniques for an efficient learning new information.
## Web-development decisions applied while making this project:
* HTML and CSS coding;
* BEM methodology;
* CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout;
* pseudo-classes for CSS selectors;
* YouTube API and iframe for adding video content;
* transition, animation and transformation + keyframes.
